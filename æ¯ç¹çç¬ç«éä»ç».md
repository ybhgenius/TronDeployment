# Bitdog Introduction

## 1. Introduction

Bitdog is the KOL of TRON's Chinese community. It has set up a TRON fan group on its own with more than 6000 advocates. Our team is based in Beijing and mainly works with video content — we reedit classic videos from home and abroad into videos related to the cryptocurrency field in a timely fashion. Thanks to our experienced team members (from major video websites in China like Youku and Aiqiyi), our content has been widely recognized by cryptocurrency fans for its professionalism. In addition, with the support of the community, Bitdog has also opened its WeChat public account, as well as Weibo, Toutiao, and other accounts with thousands of followers (Weibo alone has 36,100 followers) and over 10,000 views per video.
