# Freewallet Releases The First TRON Wallet

Freewallet is one of the first top companies to fully support the TRON coin — the official currency of TRON, a decentralized entertainment content sharing platform that will eventually leverage blockchain and peer-to-peer network technology. Today, Freewallet is releasing a wallet dedicated to TRX on Android and is also adding TRX to its flagship wallet, Multiwallet, available on iOS, Android, and web.

TRON wallet by Freewallet on Android can be topped up by almost any cryptocurrency. The Multiwallet app helps to manage multiple coins and cross-exchanging them in one place.

Unlike other TRON hodlers, Freewallet users don’t have to deposit their ERC-20 TRX to an exchange to swap them for the new TRX. All Freewallet users that have any TRX(ERC-20) in their Token Wallet on July 25rd will have their tokens automatically swapped for the new TRX, accessible via TRON Wallet and Multiwallet with zero effect on the balance.

“We have always tried to be the first to support coins that make an impact on cryptocommunity,” states Alvin Hagg, Freewallet co-founder. “TRX is the 11th cryptocurrency right now and we are proud to help holders to make transactions right after mainnet launch.”
