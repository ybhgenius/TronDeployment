# Utorrent（超级代表竞选资料）

## 一、介绍：

µTorrent (officially called "micro" torrent but often called "u" torrent) is a torrent client that was originally created by Ludvig Strigeus (ludde) to be the lightest and fastest torrent client. µTorrent is currently maintained by a team of developers at BitTorrent, Inc. A client is simply a computer program that follows the rules of a protocol. In this sense, a torrent client is not much different than a Web browser client, such as Mozilla Firefox or Apple Safari. But where a browser client follows the rules of the HTTP protocol (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to move data and files over the Internet, a torrent client follows the rules of the BitTorrent protocol to do the same. Just as there are multiple HTTP clients, there are multiple BitTorrent clients, and µTorrent is one such BitTorrent client.   The BitTorrent protocol was invented in 2001 by Bram Cohen to solve, among other problems, the network congestion that occurs when many people try to download the same file from a centralized server. BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer protocol, so it avoids the centralized server and allows people to download files from each other. Unlike with a centralized server, the more users trying to get the same file, the faster and more efficient the file is transferred.   As a practitioner of BitTorrent Protocol, µTorrent shares the values and vision with another SR participant, BitTorrent. As such, µTorrent will also participate in SR election. In the hope of being elected as an SR, µTorrent will promote the value of decentralizing the Internet and will enable all µTorrent users to enjoy more freedom online.

## 三、社区计划

As illustrated in the expenditure plan a lot of Tron will go back into people holding Tron and into hardware capacity for Testnet, future Betanet and of course Mainnet. Up and above that I will act as Tron ambassador for Africa continent and will push a lot of content via these methods:
+ YouTube videos – I create YouTube videos illustrating how to do things. These how to videos cover simple things like how to buy Tron, setup SR nodes, develop on Tron, etc.
+ Medium Posts – Similar info but text based version of YouTube videos
+ Twitter – Push out the content to broader community
+ Reddit - Push out the content to broader community

## 四、预算

All Tronix will be used in the first year for the following
+ I will immediately start sharing with Tron community when in top 27 and creating blocks, Tronix will be shared by launching several initiatives to promote Tron. Within 1-2 month from launch my share percentage will increase drastically to be sharing up to 80% of Tronix with ecosystem in the form of 75% with voters, 5% to donate to development projects within ecosystem. All payments made to Tron voters with balances above a specific % on a regular basis! % to be determined based on transaction expenses at a later stage when mainnet launched.
+ Any Tron remaining will be left in Tron network for future funding. No Tronix will be withdrawn for my own benefit in the first year.
